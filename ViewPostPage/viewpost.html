          <h3 class="blog-post-title">Juventus vs Barcelona, Champions League: Final Score 0-2, Barça play excellent team game, remain perfect
             in Europe</h3>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">October 29, 2020 by <a href="#">Jacob</a></p>
  
          <p>
            Barcelona remain perfect in the Champions League thanks to an impressive 2-0 win over Juventus at the Allianz Stadium thanks to goals 
            from Ousmane Dembélé and Lionel Messi. Barça played a complete game as a team, with excellent individual performances as well and a clean 
            sheet against Juve in Turin, which is a rarity.

        <h4>FIRST HALF</h4>
          <p>Barça made a very fast start, with three big chances in less than two minutes and a lot of intensity and hunger to recover the ball. 
            But they also had to deal with an intense and hungry Juventus team that pressed very high looking to force mistakes at the back.
            The Blaugrana struggled to get out of their own half, but once they finally did they got a goal: Ousmane Dembélé received the ball in space, 
            put on a couple of moves and fired a shot with his right foot that deflected off Leonardo Bonucci and went over Szczesny into the net.
          </p>
          <p>
            Juventus got a hold of the ball and started to go forward looking for an equalizer, and Álvaro Morata scored twice only to have both goals 
            disallowed for offside. Other than those two moments, the Old Lady looked dangerous at times but the Barça backline did a good job of avoiding 
            big trouble. At halftime, Barça were playing well with the ball, had a deserved lead and looked solid enough without the ball, but they still 
            needed another goal to ensure the victory
           </p>
        
        <h4>SECOND HALF</h4> 
            <p>
            The second half started with another goal disallowed for Morata for offside, his third of the night. But that was about it for Juventus when 
            it came to attacking prowess, as the hosts struggled mightily to create any meaningful offense with Paulo Dybala far from his best.
            </p>
            <p>
            Barça did a masterful job of keeping possession and forcing Juve to run after the ball, and Miralem Pjanic continued to play an exceptional 
            game in midfield controlling the tempo and creating dangerous chances with smart passes, and Barça continued to come up with big opportunities.
            Messi, Pedri and Griezmann all had big chances to score but couldn’t, and as we reached the final 10 minutes there was still an opportunity for Juve to equalize despite their struggles in attack. But Barça did a great job of keeping the ball, and Lionel Messi scored a penalty in the 90th minute to ensure the win.
            </p>
            <p>
            The final whiste came to end an excellent victory for Barça. In the first day without Josep Maria Bartomeu in charge, Barça put together their best performance of the season so far. Is this hope?
            </p>
